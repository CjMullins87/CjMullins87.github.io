Hi, my name is Chris and I am an analyst living in the greater Houston, TX area.

I was born and raised in Houston, TX before eventually going to UT in Austin in 2006. I graduated from UT in 2010 with a BA in Geography, and graduated from the FlatIron School in May of 2020. In between all those milestones, my first exposure to programming languages came through an introductory MatLab course at UH.

From there, I've followed my passion for 'why' and coupled it with my interest in programming to become a data analyst who specializes in Python programming and packages.

This specific experiment is dedicated to cataloging in an effective and simple format:

1. What I'm working on, aka Problems I'm Solving
2. How I'm doing it, aka Tools I'm Using/Building
3. What's next, aka The Next Step
