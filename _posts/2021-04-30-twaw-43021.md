## Problems I'm Solving
**I hate looking up enums:**

Honestly I don't have every enum in the database memorized, so, this means that I have kept spreadsheets, notebooks, and jpegs with useful enum definitions in them.

These are great for looking up the meanings to things quickly (or, it would be if they were centralized), but I really need something that integrates well with Pandas.

So, after work one day, I went back and downloaded all the enums, formatted them into a nested dictionary, packaged them with a recall and lookup functioner, and thus created my first custom python module.

## Tools I'm Using or Building
#### Using:
* Python, Pandas

#### Building:
* A custom internal enum module that integrates with Pandas

## The Next Step
* Distributed it to the team the next morning!
* The best part is it works with Pandas  `.replace()` functions, since a lookup returns a dictionary with `'enum': 'definition'` pairs.
