## Problems I'm Solving
**Size and Scope:**

A typical "problem" I have to answer is assessing the size and scope of an opportunity. This usually starts out with a few casual conversations about what defines the scope of the problem, before eventually turning into a SQL query and a python analysis.

**Pattern detection, continued:**

Completing that previous project meant that the probabilistic model I built got moved into live testing. So far it's working well, and it's helping up us start conversations with partners about their practices.

## Tools I'm Using or Building
#### Using:
* Pandas, SQL, Python

#### Building:
* dashboarding in Amazon Quicksight

## The Next Step
* The trick for 'size and scope' type projects is to always make sure you get your stakeholders on the same page about what you're going to be evaluating.
* Continuing analytical/dashboarding support for operations initiatives I've helped with.
