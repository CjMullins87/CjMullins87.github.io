## Problems I'm Solving
**Insights without data:**

Not every problem has data readily available, and the next project is in this wheelhouse. As a result, a significant part of the project is going to revolve around questions about "What data do we track?" and "How do we track it?"

Since data-keeping has stakeholders at all levels (Engineers who will add tables and fields to the database; managers who want to view reports; CS agents who will be imputing the data directly; fellow analysts who need something standardized and accessible), a big part of the next week is going to be 1:1 feedback with these groups to get insights.

## Tools I'm Using or Building
#### Using:
* Excel, google docs, zoom

#### Building:
* None for this immediate project

## The Next Step
* Definitely going to bring as many experienced experts to the table as I can, then collect final recommendations into a draft document for submission
* The pipeline I developed over the last couple weeks got completed earlier in this week; I ran about 100,000 records through it and delivered the results via spreadsheet.
