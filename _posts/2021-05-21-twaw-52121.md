## Problems I'm Solving
**Dashboarding:**

The query library I started developing last week really came in handy this week as I sought to dashboard a specific pool of data. As I fine-tuned my queries, I back-built definitions and then fed those into other, current, existing queries so that my reporting can be consistent. In the end, I spent about three days playing with the SQL to understand whether the output was meaningful and accurate, then from there I was able to roll those findings out to other queries I'd used, and finally, I spent about a day building the dashboard in Quicksight.

The biggest benefit so far to this application of the library is consistency - I can speak to why my numbers are what they are, and how they play together with other numbers in the same dashboard and in the broader ecosystem.

## Tools I'm Using or Building
#### Using:
* Amazon Quicksight
* Gitlab
* Atom

#### Building:
* Dashboard
* Modular query library

## The Next Step
* Data monitoring, to make sure the outputs are robust
* Potential f/u w/ stakeholders regarding results
