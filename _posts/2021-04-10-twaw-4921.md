## Problems I'm Solving
**Distilling meaningful strings from an array of similar strings/noisy substrings:**

>How do we meaningfully condense ['Campbells Soup', 'Campbells', 'Cambells Soup', 'Frittata', 'CAMPBELLS SOup'] into ['Campbells Soup']?

Not super sure how to proceed with this one. Current plan is definitely to clean the text data using standards from NLP (ie all lowercase, remove special characters, remove numbers). Best idea I can think of to proceed is to tokenize the strings and find meaningful tokens and bigrams. Haven't implemented a fix like this before, so it will require some research effort.

**Identifying substring patterns within an array of strings:**

>What patterns can we see in the set of strings ['animal', 'alpha', 'apple', 'arrange', 'array']?

We can see they all begin with A, but how do we programmatically address this? In my dataset a lot of the strings have the same length. So, I decided to do this by creating an `index_array` for each unique length in the array, then iterating over each string and updating the index array, such that the final output array shows the frequency with which a given character is in a given location.

This example is alphabetical, but my work is numerical, so the fxns below are only designed to work with numbers, but you could modify them to do the same thing for alphabetical characters.

## Tools I'm Using or Building
#### Using:
* [Fuzzywuzzy](https://pypi.org/project/fuzzywuzzy/) fuzzy string matching.

#### Building:
`[to be updated]`

## The Next Step
* Definitely do some high level research on NLP techniques. I think tokens and bigrams will be the way to go. If I can find bigrams and tokens that correlate to teach other, that might be a good way to condense.
* Eventually these two techniques are going to feed into each other, so I'll need to figure out whether to pipeline `numerical patterns -> string patterns` or `string patterns -> numerical patterns`
